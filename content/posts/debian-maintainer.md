As of today (2024-03-12) I'm now a Debian Maintainer (DM). This means that I
can now upload certain[^1] packages to the archives without a sponsor[^2].

[^1]: A Debian Developer (DD) has to grant me upload rights to a package, so I
    can't just upload anything willy-nilly.
[^2]: My PGP key is not yet in the Maintainers keyring, so I can't actually
    upload right now. This will (hopefully) change in the next few days.

Most of my work has been with the Go and Python teams, and I'm currently
working on packaging [croc].

I started contributing to Debian during an university course. I started going
to the weekly [Debian Brasília local group][debianbsb] meetings and interacting
with its members. Everyone there is super nice and helpful, and my interactions
with them were a strong factor in my desire to keep contributing after the
course ended.

Most of my sponsored uploads were made by [sergiodj], who was **very** patient
when answering my endless, and sometimes stupid, questions. Thank you, Sergio.

## Next steps

My main goals right now are:

1. Keep my packages up-to-date and bug-free.
2. Package other software that I personally use, such as [goimapnotify] and
   [localias].
3. Start interacting more with people from outside the Debian Brasília local
   group.
4. Maybe get into Rust packaging.
