**Beware: There might be spoilers ahead.**

I just finished reading the [Remembrance of Earth's Past] trilogy, a
Science Fiction novel series written by the Chinese author [Liu
Cixin].  The books tells a story about the humanity discovery of
another alien civilization, which turns hostile and tries to invade
and conquer the solar system.

Some people describe the trilogy as [hard science fiction], a genre of
science fiction that categorizes stories that try to be scientifically
and logically accurate. Although some sections of the books are not
that accurate (I cannot understand how unfolding protons into lower
dimensions to make their usable area bigger and building a set of
computers on those particles is scientific), the books do a good job
of explaining what is going on in (at least pseudo-) scientific terms.

I came across the series on a Reddit post, and was immediately hooked
on the concept. I started reading the first book on 2023-12-11 and
finished the third one on 2024-01-02.

I highly recommend them. The story spans a really long time period and
shows how humanity changes and evolves to deal with problems that
appear. The last few chapters of the final book are mind-bending, and
I couldn't stop reading.

I gave all three books 4/5 stars on Goodreads.
