== site ==

this repository holds the source code of my personal website, built with Tcl
and Pandoc. give it a visit at https://puida.xyz

= TODO =

1. rss/atom/jsonfeed
2. figure out better templating
3. write a djot parser and use it instead of pandoc (this will be hard)
  3.1 figure out syntax highlighting (maybe treesitter)
4. deploy from github actions (should be easy)
  4.1 reproducible environment with nix
